    "text": "I am Harsha Chamara Hewage, a PhD candidate at Cardiff Business School (Data Lab for Social Good). My research sits at the intersection of machine learning, time‑series forecasting and healthcare supply chains. I design methods to estimate true demand under censored observations (stockouts & service interruptions) and translate those estimates into inventory policies that improve availability of essential health commodities.\nI work closely with supervisors and collaborators across academia and practice, and I enjoy building reproducible forecasting pipelines (R/Quarto/Git/Docker), delivering hands‑on training, and translating technical research into operational guidance for supply chain practitioners."

    "text": "Wrapping up\n\nMethodological skills involve making informed choices at each stage of research – from philosophical stance to data collection methods.\nNo single paradigm or method is “best” for all questions. The goal is to align your approach with your research question and objectives, and to be able to justify your choices.\nUnderstanding these foundations helps you critically evaluate others’ research and conduct your own studies in a rigorous, reflective, and ethical manner."

The object my_data is not the same as the object My_Data.\nWhen choosing names for things, be concise, consistent, and informative.\nFollow the tidyverse style guide and name things in lower case, separating words with the underscore character, _, as needed.\nYou can combine multiple words in naming, e.g. word1_word2_word3.\nDo not use spaces when naming things or typing names"

What a function does?\n\nWe give the function some information, it acts on that information, and some results come out the other side.\nInformation is given to functions through arguments/inputs. Most functions accept one or more named arguments/inputs. e.g. functionname(argument1, argument2,…)\nA function’s arguments are the things it needs to know in order to do something.\nFunctions take inputs via their arguments, do something, and return outputs which we call “values”. The value depends on what the function does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nWhenever you want to perform a task in R or Python, ask yourself: Which function in R or Python can I use to do this?"
