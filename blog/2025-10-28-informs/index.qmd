Last week I attended the 42nd International Symposium of Forecasting at the University of Oxford. This was my first in-person conference since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. I met many colleagues and friends and listened to many inspiring talks.

I presented two papers myself and co-authored four others presented by my colleagues and Ph.D. students.
